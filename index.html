<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>The Branford Price Miller Library is the library of Portland State University. Previously called library west, it was re-named after PSU’s second president Branford Price Miller who served from 1959-1968. The library houses over a million volumes and is the largest academic library in the Portland area, with a towering six floors.</p>

		<h2>Construction History</h2>
		<p>The library was built in two phases. Phase one was completed on January 19th, 1968 and roughly cost three million dollars. Its architects designed the concrete library to juxtapose against pre-existing landscape features by sinking the building into its block and creating a green living room space for the campus community that merged with the South Park blocks. Phase two was completed in April 1991, and cost eleven million dollars. The second addition expanded the building east while also maintaining some of the original landscape which included a convex glass wall that was designed to surround a historic copper beech tree. There was a thought of doing a third phase which would have added 4 extra floors but it was never enacted.</p>

		<h2>Beech Tree</h2>
		<p>The beech tree functions as a centerpiece for the miller library and was planted in 1890 by the Joseph Franklin Watson family. After their home was demolished in the mid 1960’s, the decision to build around the tree was made by the architect because he wanted to preserve the tree.</p>

		<h2>Remodeling and Supplementary Info.</h2>
		<p>The miller library was remodeled in 2001 to create a learning center, technology upgrades and new furnishings. The library also launched the Oregon Sustainable Community Digital Library in 2005 to contain land use planning documents created in Oregon. Until 2007, Millar library served as the state’s regional federal depository library when it became one of the four libraries sharing the collection.</p>
